# H_ng W_rds (Hang Words)

H_ng W_rds, or Hang Words, is a simple game that had been modified to be more educational. It is very simple and straightforward to use by basing it on hangman, a simple game that is widely known. This can challenge and engage them with many interesting words.

## Design Process

This is an app created for anyone who wants to spend their time for fun but also to engage their brain to think about words. This would be very effective due to the simplicity and speed of a hangman game. While other games like crossword puzzles can be much more challenging, they cannot compete with how easy it would be for someone to finish a game of hang man.
- As a student, it could be a way to challenge them to learn new words when they are bored while having it be something fun to do.

### Features
- In built keyboard - allows users to play the game on devices without keyboards like on a touchscreen tablet
